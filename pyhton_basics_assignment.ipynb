        "\n",
        "1.What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        " - Python is an interpreted , object-oriented , high level programming language . It is known for its simplocity and readability and it is developed by Guido Van Rossum in 1991.Pyhton is popular because it is a combination of simplicity , versatility, strong communication support . It also has libraries which ehnace the productivity ,simpllify programming tasks and extend the language capabilities .\n",
        "\n",
        "2 What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        " - A Python interpreter is a computer program that executes code directly and  translates code into machine code.It provide features like interactive execution, error handling and cross platform compatibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        " - Pre-defined keywords in python are the reserved words that have special meaning in the language . These keywords cannot be used as identifiers because they are part of the syntax of the language.\n",
        " examples of keywords are : False , None, True, break, continue etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        " - No, the keyword cannot be used as variable name because keyword define the languages syntax and structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is mutability in Python?  \n",
        " - Mutability refers to the ability to change an object's value or state after it has been created.for example, lists and dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        " - list are mutable because it is designed to allow easy modifications of their elements whereas the tuples in python are immutable because once it is created the elements of tuples can't be modified further and hence it cannot be changed .\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, \"==\"and \"is\" operators are both used for comparison but they serve different purposes. The \"==\" operator checks for equality of values which means it evaluates whether the values of two objects are the same. On the other hand, \"is\" operator checks for identity, meaning it determines whether two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        " -  In Python, Logical operators carry out logical operations and return Boolean values based on the result.Logical operators are used in programming to create test expressions that control program flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is type casting in Python?\n",
        " - Type casting in Python is the process of converting a variable's data type to another data type. It's also known as type conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        " -  Implicit type casting occurs when the compiler automatically converts a smaller type to a larger type when there is no loss of data while the explicit type casting occurs when the programmer manually changes the data type of a value and there is a possibility of loss of data .\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        " - The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of a program by making decisions based on certain conditions.It makes code more easier and efficient to read .\n",
        "\n",
        "12.How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  - In Python, elif is short form of  \"else-if\" and is used when the first if statement isn't true, but we want to check for another condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        " - In Python programming language for loop is used when the number of iterations is already known and While loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        " -  we use a while loop if we do not know how many times a loop will need to run because while loops are ideal when the number of iterations is not predetermined. To do number calculations, both while and for loops can be used, but typically a for loop is preferred if you know the exact number of iteration.\n",
